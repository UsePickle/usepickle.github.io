Timelines keep your clients in the loop and are very useful and transparent. Many people use them for Real Estate, but you can also use them for anything involving customers. 


Some examples of how others are using Timelines:

3. Project Management
4. Event Planning
5. [Real Estate](https://igotablog.com/how-realtors-are-using-pickle/){:target="_blank"}
6. And so much more.

Timelines work great for projects that you want to be transparent about with your clients. In addition to sharing status updates, todos, and automatically emailing clients, they also allow you to share files securely.
