## How to use Custom Fields

To use a custom field, simply visit a contat and click edit. Then, at the bottom of the page, you'll see all of your custom fields. 

If you don't have any custom fields, you can create them. Custom fields are great for filtering contacts using search, remembering various pieces of information about someone and much more.

Custom fields sort of act like a spreadsheet. If you had a list of contacts in a spreadsheet, the custom fields would be various column names. 



## Examples

With custom fields you can store anything such as their job title, point of contact, birthday, anniversay, and more. Here's an example of some custom fields from one of our accounts:
