One of the more powerful features of Pickle is being able to customize it with various data sources, integrations, and the API.

## Dashboard Panels

Dashboard panels are the little boxes you see on the overview page. They can show anything from the internet such as:

- The number of website visitors.
- Quantity of people who have RSVPd to your event.
- Revenue over the last week.
- New Proposals.
- Deals won/lost.
- New signups in your App.
- The amount of people in your Pickle account that are match a certain set of data.
- And so much more. 

## Integrations with other Apps
One of the best ways to customize Pickle is through our integrations. Our Zapier app allows you to integrate with tons of various apps and services. Some examples include, but are not limited to:

- Track when payments are made and attach them to a contact. ![](/images/zapier/stripe-customer-created-webhook-pickle.png)
- When someone fills out and submits a form, receive a notification and attach the form to that contact in Pickle. ![](/images/zapier/track-signups-to-newsletter-pickle.png)
- Using the API, store any data for a contact. Personally, we use this to know when a customer has signed up, upgraded, subscribed to our newsletter, etc.
